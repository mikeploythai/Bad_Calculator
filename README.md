# Bad Calculator
For my AP Computer Science Principles final project, I decided to do a calculator*.  Here it is.

To see this code in action, click onto my Code.org link down below.  This file really makes no sense unless you see it along with the UI on the Code.org App Lab.

I'll probably revisit this JS calculator one day when I can figure out how to make my own UI.

~ BUGS ~

I cannot add more than one operator (ex. I can't do '5+5*3' or else it'll glitch)

Must always click on 'Clear' before creating new equation

*It's a bad one
